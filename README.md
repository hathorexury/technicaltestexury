### How to use

This project uses node to run, so you must have node installed with npm avaible locally, here a reference how to [make it run](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager). Runs with v16 or higher versions of node.

```bash
# installs nvm (Node Version Manager)
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
# download and install Node.js (you may need to restart the terminal)
nvm install 20
# verifies the right Node.js version is in the environment
node -v # should print `v20.15.0`
# verifies the right NPM version is in the environment
npm -v # should print `10.7.0`
```

Once you got node installed, just install the project and you're ready to start coding:

```bash
yarn
yarn dev
```

### Some hints

- Icons are already installed part of [material ui](https://mui.com/material-ui/material-icons/)
- For routing we recommend `vue router`
- There is no need for any state management
